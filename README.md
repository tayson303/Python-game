# Python-game
NBA &amp; Basketball Millionaires 

I built a game using Python which was designed to emulate the "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" program. In this game, players must answer 12 questions related to basketball and the NBA to win, with the help of three lifelines.

As I am new to programming in Python, the code is not perfect. However, I plan to come back to it and improve it as I gain more experience. Despite this, the game is fully functional and provides an engaging experience for players interested in basketball.

The game utilizes various Python libraries and modules to enable the game to run smoothly. It also features a graphical user interface to enhance the user experience, making the game more interactive and enjoyable.

Overall, I am proud of my achievement in building this game and am excited to continue my journey in Python programming and game development.
