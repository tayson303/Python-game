# Python-game
NBA &amp; Basketball Millionaires 

I built a game using Python which was designed to be basketball design of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" TV program. In this game, player must answer 12 questions related to basketball and the NBA to win, with the help of three lifelines.

As I am new to programming in Python, so I am aware of that the code is not perfect. However, I plan to come back to it and improve it as I gain more programming experience. Despite this, the game is (almost!) fully functional and provides an engaging experience for players interested in basketball.

Overall, I am proud of my achievement in building this game and am excited to continue my journey in Python programming.

Have fun! :)
